# Why 2 gemspecs?
#
# Originally, this gem was named 'jekyll-picture-tag', and published on rubygems
# under this name. There was a break in development, during which push access to
# rubygems was lost. Development was later resumed, and as a workaround for that
# issue the installation instructions were to source the gem from the Github
# repository.
#
# Ultimately, the decision was made to rename it by switching the dashes for
# underscores, which follows best practice and allows pushing it to rubygems
# under the new name. The drawback of this situation is that everyone who
# followed the installaion instructions previously would see their site
# inexplicably break, as it would be searching for a gemspec that doesn't exist.
# As a workaround (to the old workaround... sigh) this gemspec lets us print a
# warning and then require the new version, which keeps old sites working while
# encouraging people to use rubygems.

    hosted on rubygems.
