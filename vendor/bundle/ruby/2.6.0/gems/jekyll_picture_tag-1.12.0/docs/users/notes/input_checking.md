# Getting cryptic build errors?

  Jekyll Picture Tag is very trusting. It doesn't do much checking of your inputs, and it does not
  fail gracefully if you for example pass it a string when it expects an array. It's on the to-do
  list, but for now if you get cryptic errors then double-check your settings and tag arguments.
