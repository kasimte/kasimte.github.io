Schafer quotes him in his Sinological notes, but goes on to barrage
all translations other than literal ones.

This got me thinking -- what do other Sinologists think of Arthur
Waley?

Did he do the West a service or a disservice in his far-ranging
translations of classical Chinese, albeit with great liberty from the
original meaning?

Is this a contribution to what Edward Said dubbed Orientalism?
